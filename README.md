# hello-world
Initial repository for MgmtbyDesign
I'm bootstrapping a start-up as a Microsoft Cloud-services Indirect Reseller through Tech Data.  I've worked as a sales/consultant for big local Novell, Cisco, & Microsoft solution/providers before and initiated their consulting practices.  I've always worked with qualified engineers before who provided the technical expertise I needed; but now I'm attempting it on my own (whether wisely or not remains to be seen).  Coding has not been my core competence.  Writing is instead my core competence, but I've been trained in engineering and have worked in that field professionally; so I'm generally comfortable with science and technology (and I learned a little coding back in the Pleistocene era).  In today's world, it seems almost reversionary to insist on writing code from scratch since what appear to be reliable coding engines are so readily available.  The more compelling issue is really time.

I've set up a virtual machine on Azure, and I've hosted my domain on GoDaddy.  I'm trying to get my e-commerce site up and running with the intention of setting up an effective collaboration site where a group of us can cooperate to take clients safetly and efficiently onto the Azure PaaS.  The economics are so compelling that, particularly in a collaborative work environment, that I just see no reason to hold back.

This sort-of long-winded introduction is by way of following the learning path suggested in the "Create Repository."
